# Utils Snippets

A very personal collection of useful [code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) that I use in my daily work.

This collection is shipped as a Visual Studio Code extension available in the Marketplace at [barbapapazes.utils-snippets-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=barbapapazes.utils-snippets-vscode).

If you're only interested by a subset of the snippets, you can find them in the [snippets directory](./snippets) file. Feel free to copy and paste them into your own snippets file.

If you have any suggestion or improvement, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my workflow.
